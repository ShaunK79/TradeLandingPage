# TradeLandingPage
A simple landing page for an electrical company

So for my learning I wanted to create something that showed off some of html and css skills so idecided to make a landing page for an electrical installation company. This could be used for any trade but as a former electrician it had to be electrical related.

So the project consists of the body, header(company name/logo), h1-h4, div's, classes, ID, sections(brief inidication of what the company does and then the call to action section), form(contact form), label(inputs for contact form) and lastly the footer.

I learnt alot from creating this - writing the HTML to then styling it using CSS. I frequently visited websites - W3schools and MDN - for a betteer understanding of how to structure and style the landing page. 

I have tried making the page responsive so that all devices are able to read it clearly.
I also intend on making the contact form active using the email.
